# How to contribute to Open-smartwatch

In case the `develop` branch is ahead of the `master` branch and the `develop` branch is stable enough, we periodically merge it into the `master`.

In order to contribute new or updated documentation, you must first create a GitHub account and fork the original repository to your own account. You can make changes, save them in your repository and then create a pull request against this repository.

Unless you are opening a pull request which only makes small corrections (for instance correcting a typo), you are more likely to get traction for your changes if you open an issue first to discuss the proposed changes. 

**IMPORTANT** If you want to create a pull request, please work based on the most recent `develop` branch - so we don't have to rebase it...

If you are reading this page, you are possibly interested in contributing to our project 😄 . We have an active (and friendly) developer group and would love to get your help! Some common ways you can support us are:

* Testing the code
* Reporting issues on GitHub, if you see a problem (or adding detail to existing issues that also affect you)
* Fixing issues 😁
* Adding new features
* Reviewing existing pull requests and possibly also contributing to them
* Translations are always a good idea...
