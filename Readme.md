# HowTo Run

**Please read the documentation on the [website](https://open-smartwatch.github.io/resources/firmware/)!**

## Prerequirements

* install [PlatformIO Core](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation.html) or [PlatformIO IDE](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/integration/ide/vscode.html#ide-vscode) (which installs PlatformIO core automatically)
* **For improved LUA Script support, see env:pico32_LIGHT_EDITION_PREBUILD_LUA**: install [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/Doc4.0/SWIGDocumentation.html#Preface_installation) (also available in most package managers, e.g. `brew install swig`)
* Then clone this repository

```
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Open-Smartwatch/open-smartwatch-os.git
```

## build 

The `master` branch is a stable version and the `develop` branch is a beta version. Recommended that you upload the `master` branch.

### Visual Studio Code

Open the cloned repo in VSCode:

```
$ code open-smartwatch-os
```

And rename file `include/config.h.example` to `include/config.h` and adapt the values according to your requirements and press `F5` to build it.

### CLI

You can instead go to the repo folder with your terminal and run

```
$ pio run -e pico32_LIGHT_EDITION -t upload
```

respectively

```
$ pio run -e pico32_GPS_EDITION -t upload
```

Depending on the watch model.

## Debugging(CLI)

If you want to print out the log for debugging, following command:

```
$ pio device monitor
```

## Creating Screen Shots of your Apps

<img src="./screenshots/watchface_analog_osw.png" width="40%"><img src="./screenshots/watchface_digital_osw.png" width="40%">

* Wi-Fi needs to be able to connect for this to work.
* you will need bash and ImageMagick for the helper scripts to work

The raw screenserver runs in the background and prints via serial:

```
Started Raw ScreenServer
http://<IP_OF_WATCH>/api/screenserver
```

### HowTo

 * add `-D RAW_SCREEN_SERVER` to your build flags in `platformio.ini`
 * build + flash + reset watch
 * wait for the server to be started (see msg above)
 * run `bash fetchScreen.sh <IP_OF_WATCH> screenshot.png`
 * run `bash composeScreen.sh screenshot.png screenshot_composed.png`

The `fetchScreen.sh` downloads the raw image buffer from the running screen server, and converts the image to png. The `composeScreen.sh` creates the image with a surrounding smartwatch (light edition).

#### The fast way (recommended)

Run the following inside the `open-smartwatch-os` directory:

```
$ cd scripts/screen_capture/
$ ./createScreenshot.sh <IP_OF_WATCH> <SCREENSHOT>
```
* The captured file can be found in the `screenshot/` folder inside the `open-smartwatch-os` directory.
## Troubleshooting

For more information on troubleshooting, see [Wiki](https://open-smartwatch.github.io/resources/firmware/#troubleshooting).

### Arduino_TFT.h: No such file or directory

You did not clone the repository with the `--recursive-submodules` flag.

### 'LANG_STW_START' was not declared in this scope

You did not rename `include/config.h.example`

### Failed to connect to ESP32: Timed out waiting for packet header

You did not hold down BTN1(FLASH) and then tap the RESET button on the watch whilst platform.io was trying to connect.
